## Description :dizzy:
As microservices become more and more common, there is more interest in optimizing their
development, making it faster, reducing the complexity and making it less error and bug
prone.
This work aims to explore how Model-driven Engineering (MDE) can be used to aid
microservicesâ€™ development, especially Java microservices using Spring Boot.
 JHipster is a popular open-source development platform that generates Spring Boot and Angular/React applications for the modern web. The use of JHipster will enable us to quickly scaffold a microservices application with a robust set of features, including security, monitoring, and logging.

We will be using MDE to model the different components of the microservices, such as the data models, interfaces, and behavior, using JSON. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON schema will be used to define the structure of the data models and generate the corresponding Java classes.
